Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof  When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature  Through the use of abstraction and logic mathematics developed from counting calculation measurement and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects  Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist81
The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia  Their contributions to mathematics astronomy and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes47
Physics is the natural science that studies matter its motion and behavior through space and time and the related entities of energy and force Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves44
Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms molecules and ions their composition structure properties behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances  In the scope of its subject chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology  It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level71
Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms including their physical structure chemical processes molecular interactions physiological mechanisms development and evolution  Despite the complexity of the science certain unifying concepts consolidate it into a single coherent field  Biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life genes as the basic unit of heredity and evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species70
